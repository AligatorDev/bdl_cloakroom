# bdl_cloakroom
A NativeUI cloakroom system for vRPex framework. The front-end was reused from 'nav_departamento' of Ziraflix (github.com/ziraflix) and the back-end was developed by Edu#0069 from E&amp;G Vendas (discord.gg/bABGBEX). A little hard to configure but it worth the work. Simple but pretty and functional. Enjoy and follow the gth to see the changelog of this script.
